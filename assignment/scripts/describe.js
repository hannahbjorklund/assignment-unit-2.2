// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called name. We set name equal to the string 'Dane.'
// We check if name is equal to Mary.
// If name is Mary, then  we console.log 'Hi, Mary!'
// If name is anything other than Mary, we console.log 'How do you do?'
// The result of this code would yield 'How do you do?' Since name is Dane.

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We create a variable named secret. This variable will be assigned a value later.
// We create a second variable name code, and give it the value 123 (a number)
// We check to see if code is equal to 123. If it is, we make secret equal to the string 'super' and multiply code by 2. The new value of code is 246.
// Then, we check to see if code is greater than 250. If it is, secret is changed to the string 'duper'. In this case, it is not greater than 250.
// We console.log secret
// The resulting output is 'super'.

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// Create a variable named isStudent and set it equal to the boolean value true.
// Create a variable named age and let it equal the number 34
// Create a variable named zip and let it equal the number 55407
// Check to see if isStudent is true AND if zip is greater than 8000
// If so, we console.log 'You're a student on the West Coast!'
// If this is not the case, we check to see if isStudent is false OR if age is less than 30
// If either is true, we console.log 'What are your hobbies?'
// If isStudent is true, but zip is less than 8000, console.log 'Welcome to Prime!'
// If this is also not the case, then we console.log 'How about the weather?'
// The result of this code would be the output 'Welcome to Prime!'
//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);

  console.log('What are your hobbies?');

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
